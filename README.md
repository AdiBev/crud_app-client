# Pokedex CRUD app

I made this CRUD app using React, Redux and with UI library Ant design. From this project I learned about Ant design UI library which integrates 
very well with React. Having to work with Material-UI framework, I find Ant design library easier to handle. 

I used Redux to handle the app's state and I learned more about Redux and react-redux.

Overall from this app I learned a new library and a skill.
